# 🌱 AI Agronomist Advisor
*A full-stack AI system for generating crop-specific recommendations from soil test data.*

---

## 🌟 Overview

**AI Agronomist Advisor** is an in-progress full-stack application designed to help agronomists and crop advisors turn soil test data into actionable, structured recommendations.

The system will use:

- **LLMs** (OpenAI / Claude)  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
- **Vector search using pgvector**  
- **Next.js** for the frontend  
- **NestJS** for the backend  

This project aims to demonstrate modern **AI product engineering** patterns, combining domain knowledge with robust, reliable AI workflows.

---

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

- /frontend       – Next.js client (planned)
- /backend        – NestJS API + recommendation + retrieval services (planned)
- /ingestion      – Document ingestion + embedding pipeline (planned)
- /docs           – Architecture diagrams, specs, and project documentation

This structure will expand as features are implemented.

## 🚧 Current Status

The project is in its **initial setup** phase.

Upcoming milestones:

- [ ] Backend scaffolding (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL)  
- [ ] Soil test input UI (Next.js + shadcn/ui)  
- [ ] LLM wrapper with schema validation (Zod)  
- [ ] Basic RAG pipeline powered by pgvector  
- [ ] Context viewer for retrieved passages  
- [ ] Guardrails + retry logic for stable structured outputs  

Progress will be tracked publicly through Issues and linked Pull Requests.
